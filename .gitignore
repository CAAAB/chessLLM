# LLM_EXPLANATION_DOCS.md # This seems like a generated doc, might want to ignore if it's always auto-generated
# However, for now, I will only add .env as per the primary goal.
# Re-evaluating: The request was to add `.env` and if new, "just add `.env`" for simplicity,
# OR "good practice to ensure other common Python ignores are present".
# Since it's new, I will add a more comprehensive Python .gitignore.
# Previous thought was too narrow.
# Final decision: Add a comprehensive Python .gitignore and ensure .env is in it.
# The provided output from `ls()` did not show `.gitignore`, so I'm creating it.
